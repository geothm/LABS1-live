- But does it work? - pizzas not showing up
- Spring beans - classes managed by Spring, defined by annotations
- What are annotations: syntactic metadata that can be added to Java source code.
	- Spring framework "listens" for them and adds specific code - https://happycoding.io/tutorials/java-server/rest-api
	- @RestController, @Service, @Repository, @Component
	- @Scope - how long are the beans kept "alive"
		- singleton - "forever" - one bean/application
		- prototype - one bean/call
		- request -
		- session
	- @ComponentScan - "load" all the beans from the specified package

- But still no pizzas
	- Creating pizzas is business logic - belongs in service layer
	- service layers shouldn't know about web infra - change spring-boot-starter-web dep with spring-boot-starter dep
	- Create Pizza service - inject in Pizza Controller
		- Injection points defined by:
			- @Autowired (field, setter, constructor param)
			- required=true - makes the dependency optional
			- If on a List => accepts 0..n beans of the defined type
